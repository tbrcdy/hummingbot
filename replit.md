# Hummingbot Project

## Overview
This is a basic Hummingbot cryptocurrency trading bot skeleton project. The original repository contained minimal files, so this has been set up as a foundational Python console application that can be extended with trading functionality.

## Project Structure
- `main.py` - Main application entry point with basic bot framework
- `requirements.txt` - Python dependencies
- `README.md` - Original project readme
- `LICENSE` - Apache 2.0 license

## Current State
- **Language**: Python 3.11
- **Type**: Console application 
- **Status**: Running with basic skeleton functionality
- **Dependencies**: requests, python-dotenv, pytest

## Running the Application
The application runs automatically via the configured workflow:
- **Workflow Name**: "Hummingbot Console"
- **Command**: `python main.py`
- **Output Type**: Console
- **Status**: Running continuously with 5-second heartbeat ticks

## Architecture
- Simple console-based bot framework
- Heartbeat monitoring system
- Graceful shutdown handling
- Extensible structure for adding trading logic

## Recent Changes (September 24, 2025)
- Set up Python 3.11 environment
- Created basic bot application structure
- Installed core dependencies (requests, python-dotenv, pytest)
- Configured console workflow for continuous operation
- Added basic heartbeat and monitoring functionality

## Next Steps
This skeleton provides a foundation that can be extended with:
- Market data integration
- Trading strategy implementation
- Configuration management
- Logging and monitoring
- Database connectivity for trade history
- API integrations with cryptocurrency exchanges

## User Preferences
- Project imported from minimal GitHub repository
- Console-based application preferred for this type of trading bot
- Python chosen as the primary language for cryptocurrency trading functionality
